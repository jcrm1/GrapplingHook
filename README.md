# GrapplingHook
Barebones Spigot 1.8.9 plugin to add a grappling hook. I wrote this when I was first learning Java a few years ago and just spent 10 minutes sprucing it up before uploading. The code is simple, and it is mostly just a toy.
## Commands
- `/givehook`: Give the user a grappling hook
## Usage
Use the hook like a fishing rod. The plugin will propel you towards your hook when you reel it back in. It behaves like the grappling hook on Hypixel.
